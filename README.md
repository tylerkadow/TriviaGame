# TriviaGame

My code for a simple My Little Pony Trivia Game.
This project was part of a coding bootcamp assignment to further understand the functions in JavaScript.
Included in the app.js file is the function setInterval(), which can be used to increment (or in this case decrement) a variable every time a set period of time passes.
For example, in this file setInterval(decrement, 1000) decreases a variable every 1000 milliseconds, or every second.

Have fun!
